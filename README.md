# snippets

This repository is for frequently used solutions.

- Javascript
- jQuery
- CSS (also files like LESS)
- HTML
- Bootstrap
- etc.

This repository should be a quick reference and copy-paste source.


Snippet idea:

 1. jQuery extension that gathers all HTML5 data-* attributes of a jQuery selector (the types (what's after data-) and the values) in an array or JSON (parameter), and has the following functions:
  - findType (accepts type) - "not" operator should be used
  - findValue (accepts value) - "not" operator should be used
  - sortType (accepts type)
  - sortValue  (accepts value)
  - filterType (accepts type) - "not" operator should be used
  - filterValue (accepts value) - "not" operator should be used
  - orderBy (ASC or DESC)
  - addType - "not" operator should be used
  - setValue (accepts type, value) - "not" operator should be used for type
  - handles errors

Question: CSS selectors or existing jQuery functions cannot do this?

 2. jQuery extension that inserts jQuery objects at a certain index (e.g. from indexOf(3) or eq(5))

 3. Moving jQuery object from one DOM parent to another, and creating the visible animation of the movement (this should be used for images)
